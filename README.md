# OpenGallery – Backend Service

OpenGallery is a Spring Boot–based backend application that provides secure authentication, role-based access control, and media management for an artist portfolio platform.

The application uses JWT for stateless authentication, integrates with AWS S3 for storing images and videos, and supports email-based notifications. Artists can upload media files or share external content links, while clients can view a consolidated portfolio through secure APIs.

## Key Features
- JWT-based authentication and authorization

- Media upload and retrieval using AWS S3
- Support for external content links (YouTube, Instagram, etc.)
- Email notifications
- RESTful API design
